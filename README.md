  This project is an online social network-based question answer system called SO-NET Query.
•	This system utilizes the properties of a social network to forward a question to potential answer providers, ensuring that a given question receives a high-quality answer in a short period of time.
•	Website features are similar to Quora but is confined to organization/group which helps to ask confidential questions which can be discussed only within an organization.
•	The application is improved with security and efficiency enhancements by protecting user privacy and identifies and retrieves answers automatically for recurrent questions.
•	The design of SO-NET Query is based on two social network properties. First, social friends tend to share similar interests. Second, social friends tend to be trust worthy which leverages both common interest and mutual trust social network properties to improve Q&A performance.
